# A-Frame Fonts ðŸ“–

Fonts are important, by default A-Frame only ships with a few.
Not anymore. In this repo you will find all the fonts from Google Fonts converted into a MSDF format supported by A-Frame.
There is more than 2000 of them...ðŸ˜‚

## Demo

#### [ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Live demo ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ](https://etiennepinchon.github.io/aframe-fonts/)

## Getting Started

To use those fonts simply create a text entity with the attribute `font` and `shader: msdf;` (very important).

```html
<a-entity text="value:Hello; color:#FFFFFF; shader: msdf; font:https://cdn.rawgit.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts/master/fonts/creepster/Creepster-Regular.json;" position="6.7 1 -2"></a-entity>     
```

All the fonts can be served using this template:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etiennepinchon/aframe-fonts/master/fonts/[FONT_NAME]/[FONT_TYPE].json
```

Note that if you wish to download the font files, make sure you have both the .json and .png. A-Frame will automatically import the .png file.
